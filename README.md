# SQL Capstone Project ðŸ’¼

## By Den Peters Ngotho Gathitu

Welcome to my SQL Capstone Project, built as part of my journey through Data Science, AI, and Digital Business. This repository contains a step-by-step analysis of a relational database scenario, showcasing advanced SQL techniques with real-world applications.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses three core tables:
- `Salesmen`
- `Customers`
- `Orders`

With these, we answer business-critical questions including:
- Customer-Salesman matching
- City-based analysis
- Order-customer integration
- Performance evaluation

---

## Tech Stack
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)
- **Git & GitHub**
- Data Literacy + Business Logic

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repo  
  git clone https://github.com/dengathitu/SQL-Capstone-Project.git
2. Open files in your SQL environment
3. Run queries in `sales_schema.sql` to create and populate tables
4. Run queries in `questions.sql` to solve the challenge questions
